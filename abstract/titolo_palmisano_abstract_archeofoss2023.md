Version control systems (VCS), first applied to the development of software, it is now one of the common
ways through which scientists collaborate and keep track of different versions of their work. Moreover,
scientists, programmers, etc., have been using platforms like GitHub to host and share their resources
versioned through Git. While not as widely adopted as in other disciplines, Git has been used in
archaeological research. In fact, version control allows scholars to collaborate remotely (e.g., through
commit history, branches, etc.) and offers the transparency necessary to align with Open Science’s
practices. Both of these elements are crucial to reproducible research practices. However, one issue with
git is that version control of GIS data (shapefiles, geopackages) is inefficient, due to the fact that commits
cannot be displayed correctly, and it is cumbersome to track changes.
In 2020, a company named Koordinates launched Kart (formerly Sno), described as “an open-source
distributed version control system for geospatial and tabular data built on git”. Kart addresses the need for
collaboration and finer versioning of geospatial data, while also providing an integration with the open-
source software QGIS. Kart and code hosting websites provide unique resources for archaeologists, from
straightforward collaboration, to efficient hosting of digital knowledge and workflows.
In this paper, we will present how we are using Kart, QGIS, and GitHub in our project “Governance
Policies and Political Landscapes in the Southern Levant under the Neo-Assyrian Empire”. With our case
study, we hope to provide a solution to the current gap in the workflow of documentation and
collaboration among archaeologists using Geographic Information Systems. We will also introduce how
we are managing the project in an open and transparent way through Git and GitHub itself.
