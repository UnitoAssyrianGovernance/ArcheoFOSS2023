# Using kart and github for versioning and collaborating with GIS data. The case of the Assyrian Governance Project.

Version control, initially applied mostly to software development, is now one common way through which scientists collaborate and keep track of different versions of their work. Git is among the most widely adopted version control systems (VCS), with code hosting sites like GitHub among the most commonly mentioned. While not as widely adopted as in other disciplines, git is being used as one key tool in archaeological research. Version control indeed provides advantages for remote collaboration through commit history, branches, etc. and the transparency that it offers. Both of these elements are crucial to reproducible research practices (Marwick 2017). However, one issue with git is that version control of binary files such as GIS data (shapefiles, geopackages) is unable to track high-resolution changes. In fact, each change will exclusively be tracked at the macro level, and commits cannot be displayed correctly through git diffs for finer inspection. 

In 2020, Koordinates launched Kart (formerly Sno), an open-source distributed version control system for geospatial and tabular data built on git. Kart addresses the needs for collaboration and finer versioning of geospatial data, while also providing an integration with the open-source software QGIS. Kart and code hosting websites provide unique resources for archaeologists, not only for collaboration, but also for hosting digital knowledge and data. 

In this paper, we will present how we are using Kart, QGIS, and GitHub in the Assyrian Governance Project (based at the University of Turin). We will also introduce how we are managing the project in an open and transparent way through git and GitHub itself.
